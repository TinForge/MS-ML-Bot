## Description
Personal project that utilizes machine learning to create a bot for Maplestory. 
The bot performs basic attack and navigation behaviors using an object detection model trained on YoloV5n.

## Features
- YoloV5 model inference
- Processing inferred data into rect class
- Split threads for performance optimization
- Window functions for application detection & control
- Tkinter gui
- Debug overlay for drawing rects
- Basic decision-making logic based on the processed data
- Generated keyboard input to simulate player actions
